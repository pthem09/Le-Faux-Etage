# Website for Le Faux Etage community theater

Hosting link: https://pthem09.github.io/Le_Faux_Etage/

## Project overview

- Developed by Paul Them, 2024
- The website helps a fictional theater share updates on current and upcoming shows, with notices for auditions and a cart for tickets and merchandise.
- Technologies used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- Ideas for improvements:
1. Develop an active shopping cart and allow people to select quantities of each item or remove items from the cart. Order totals should appear.
2. Develop a ticketing system for the theater. If the audience capacity is 100, then the site should track how many tickets have been sold. It should display a notice when 10 or fewer tickets remain, and not allow more than 100 to be sold.
3. When window alerts are needed, more attractive alerts should display, using themes developed for the website.
